It shows all the contacts with their birthdays, gives the next upcoming birthday, or the user can search by name to see how many days till that person's birthday. It also has an  addContact and removeContact (in case the user decides to no longer keep track of that person's birthday).

# Future Work
- Show the contact's current age when you display a contact or when you show all the contacts.
- Have the user be able to create a file of their choosing. This way if they wanted to keep track of separate groups of people, like grandchildren versus co-workers, they could name the file that a contact gets saved to and displayed from.  
- Have a way so the user can log in and see their saved information.
